# IDS701_SolvingRealProblemswithDataScience
 
This repository shares my assignments and projects from the `'Solving Real Problems with Data Science'` class. This course challenges students to bridge the gap between theoretical data science exercises and real-world complexities. It emphasizes understanding stakeholder problems, selecting the right model, and effectively communicating findings—skills that are essential for becoming an effective data science professional.

In this repository, you’ll find tasks and projects where we explored various data science techniques and applied them to solve real-world problems. The assignments reflect the comprehensive approach we learned, which integrates concepts from other data science courses and teaches when and how to apply different methods. The course assumes familiarity with statistical inference and machine learning, while introducing causal inference as an additional area of focus.

The course was taught by `Nick Eubank`, and you can explore more about the course and related materials at the following link: [Solving Real Problems with Data Science](https://ds4humans.com/landing_page.html).
