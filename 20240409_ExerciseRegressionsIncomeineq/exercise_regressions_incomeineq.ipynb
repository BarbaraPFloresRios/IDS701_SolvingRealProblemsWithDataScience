    "# Estimating Gender Discrimination in the Workplace\n",

    "In this exercise we'll use data from the 2018 US Current Population Survey (CPS) to try and estimate the effect of being a woman on workplace compensation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our focus will be *only* on differential compensation in the work place, and as a result it is important to bear in mind that our estimates are not estimates of *all* forms of gender discrimination. For example, these analyses will not account for things like gender discrimination in terms of *getting* jobs. We'll discuss this in more detail below."

The file is called `morg18.dta` and is a Stata dataset. Additional data on the dataset can be found by following the links in the README.txt file in the folder, but for the moment it is sufficient to know this is a national survey run in the United States.\n",

    "The survey does include some survey weights we won't be using (i.e. not everyone in the sample was included with the same probability), so the numbers we estimate will not be perfect estimates of the gender wage gap in the United States, but they are pretty close."
